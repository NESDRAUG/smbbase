;MUSIC DATA
;square 2/triangle format
;d7 - length byte flag (0-note, 1-length)
;if d7 is set to 0 and d6-d0 is nonzero:
;d6-d0 - note offset in frequency look-up table (must be even)
;if d7 is set to 1:
;d6-d3 - unused
;d2-d0 - length offset in length look-up table
;value of $00 in square 2 data is used as null terminator, affects all sound channels
;value of $00 in triangle data causes routine to skip note

;square 1 format
;d7-d6, d0 - length offset in length look-up table (bit order is d0,d7,d6)
;d5-d1 - note offset in frequency look-up table
;value of $00 in square 1 data is flag alternate control reg data to be loaded

;noise format
;d7-d6, d0 - length offset in length look-up table (bit order is d0,d7,d6)
;d5-d4 - beat type (0 - rest, 1 - short, 2 - strong, 3 - long)
;d3-d1 - unused
;value of $00 in noise data is used as null terminator, affects only noise

;all music data is organized into sections (unless otherwise stated):
;square 2, square 1, triangle, noise
